# OctoPrint Automatic Shutdown with IFTTT

This OctoPrint plugin enables the system to be automatically sent a IFTTT Webhook Trigger then shut down after a print is finished.

The user can enable automatic shutdown and IFTTT Trigger for each print by using a checkbox in the sidebar.  Additionally, the user can trigger a shutdown by using the "shutdown now" button.  This is useful for non-admin users, who do not have access to the system menu.
